I have sales data (july2018-feb2019) of Vibha Agencies Pvt. Ltd. which produces various hydraulic parts. 
Vibha Agencies have several manufaturing plants which have different plant codes. 
Plant Buyer refers to the person who buys the parts from that particular plant. 
Each type of Part manufactured has a different Part No. and a name (Description). 
Aim - predict sales of each part for next month and create a shiny app for easy visualization.
