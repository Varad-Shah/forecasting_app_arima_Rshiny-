I have sales data (july2018-feb2019) of Vibha Agencies which produces various hydraulic parts. 
Vibha Agencies have several plants which have different plant codes. 
Plant Buyer refers to the person who buys the parts from that particular plant.
Aim - predict sales of each part for next month and create a shiny app for easy visualization.
